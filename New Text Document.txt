Notice that we use >> and not just > . This operator will append to a file. If we only used > , we would end
up overwriting the file. The cat command displays the contents of the file (or files) and then returns you to the
command line. Unlike less you have no control on how you view that text (or what you do with it). It is a
very simple, but sometimes useful, command.
